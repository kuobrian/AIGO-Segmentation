## Usage
### Running Inference

The easiest way to get started with inference is to clone this repository and use the `demo.py` script. if you have street images named `test.jpg`, then you can generate segmentation labels for them with the following command.

`demo.py` script incluide testing video single image and camera.

```shell
$ python demo.py
```
